### Project Title
Bikeshare Project by Moritz

### Description
The python code in this project makes it possible to automatically derive certain statistics of bikeshares.

As a user input it uses the city-name, the month or "all" and the day or "all" to apply filters.
-  [x] User input for city
-  [x] User input for month
-  [x] User input for day

Reading and creating csv-files.
-  [x] Reading certain csv-Files
-  [x] Generation of a total overview csv-file (file: merging_dataframes.py)

Depending on the filters a certain file is loaded, filtered by the previously selected month and day and returned in a new data frame.
- [x] Implementation of filtering
- [x] Setting columns to the save data types

In the next steps, certain statistics will be displayed:

1. time_stats:

-  [x] Most Frequent Times of Travel
-  [x] Most common month
-  [x] The most popular day of the week

2. Station_stats:
-  [x] Most Popular Stations and Trip
-  [x] Most commonly used end station
-  [x] Most frequent combination of start station and end station trip

3. Trip_duration_stats:
-  [x] Average trip duration
-  [x] Total travel time
-  [x] Mean travel time

4. user_stats:
-  [x] Counts of user types
-  [x] Counts of gender
-  [x] Earliest, most recent, and most common year of birth

In case the selection leads to no data, it will start the filtering questions again.
-  [x] Handling with empty data frames

After showing the stats, the code asks to show a few lines of raw data.
-  [x] Implementing option to show raw data
