### Date created
The project is analysing the bike share stats of Washington, Chicago and New York City.

### Project Title
Bikeshare Project by Moritz

### Description
The python code in this project makes it possible to automatically derive certain statistics of bikeshares.

As a user input it uses the city-name, the month or "all" and the day or "all" to apply filters.

Depending on the filters a certain file is loaded, filtered by the previously selected month and day and returned in a new data frame.

In the next steps, certain statistics will be displayed:

1. time_stats:

- Most Frequent Times of Travel
- Most common month
- The most popular day of the week

2. Station_stats:
- Most Popular Stations and Trip
- Most commonly used end station
- Most frequent combination of start station and end station trip

3. Trip_duration_stats:
- Average trip duration
- Total travel time
- Mean travel time

4. user_stats:
- Counts of user types
- Counts of gender
- Earliest, most recent, and most common year of birth

In case the selection leads to no data, it will start the filtering questions again.

After showing the stats, the code asks to show a few lines of raw data.
